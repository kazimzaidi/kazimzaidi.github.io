--------------------

At present I'm working with 5amily, an online gift store that sells shirts, mugs and bags customized to people's names and interests. I'm with 5amily (pronounced family) since around 9 years.

Around 2007-08, I worked with ValueMax solutions for around 7 months, and helped them build two products - Coupons4Me, which was a coupon aggregator, and Spendwrite, a yelp-like site that would host user reviews for local businesses.

During my college days, I was hired by CivicSpace USA as a Summer Training Intern, where I worked on some ecommerce related Drupal modules.

I majored in Computer Science from JMI, New Delhi in the year 2009.

Things I built
--------------
a Rails-based custom ecommerce backend, with ember.js (and later riot.js) powered frontend, with stripe and paypal as payment options, an extensible coupon creator, upsells, shipment tracking and reviews

a comprehensive MIS integrated with Google Analytics and Facebook APIs that would report campaign performances using order attribution.

an internal Facebook Ads and Creatives Creator integrated with product catalog.

ruleset-based engine that controls running adsets based on editable rules that increase or decrease budgets and close down ads based on their performance

a Facebook comments monitoring system that'd automatically reply to people's comments with products customized with their names.

a system of customizable html-based arts, which would generate a huge range of designs based on people's names and passions, and dynamically place those designs on products such as mugs and shirts.

a cacheable system of designs with their previews on multiple products by using SHA signatures to avoid redundant processing

an extensible bot messaging platform that'd parse and execute conversation scripts with Facebook Messenger users, with complete reporting.

app deployment on AWS EC2, with RDS, together with Cloudfront/S3 integration for assets

an in-house email marketing platform that'd allow to pick products and schedule them for Intercom-based mails every week -- lets write email templates using Handlebars, and an MIS to track email campaigns.

different caching strategies to optimize the site performance for different types of pages

onsite SEO, using all white hat techniques, and modern things like Google Rich Snippets and Google Products etc.

an Activity Logger to inspect user activities on site

a complete family tree platform that allows users to create family trees, collaborate, invite relatives, perform tree mergers, identify and remove duplicates, manage events, identify celebrities within family and so on.

a granular permission system that lets users choose who can see what -- and a wiki system for deceased and inactive relatives in the family tree

family tree charts generator -- descendant and ancestor charts -- extensible with different designs

a news digest that'd aggregate family news and prepare newsletters from the viewpoint of recipient

a system to run contests and giveaways

an HTML5 media uploader that lets you upload multiple images (or grab them from Facebook albums), crop and scale each of them individually -- all in the browser pre-upload

affiliate sale tracking and attribution

a system to automatically build passion and product-based Facebook Audiences based on triggers

an in-house site blog, and blog editor that'd parse links for meta etc.

bundle products that are made by combining individual ones -- and their image generation

a collaborative greeting card editor that friends sign (and write messages on) for a single recipient

Freebase integration for worldwide places data -- later we used Google Autocomplete Places for this

a referral system that rewards people who refer others to our products
