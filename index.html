            <p>
            At present I'm working with 5amily, an online
            gift store that sells shirts, mugs and bags
            customized to people's names and interests. I'm
            with 5amily (pronounced family) since around 9
            years.

            Around 2007-08, I worked with ValueMax
            solutions for around 7 months, and helped them
            build two products - Coupons4Me, which was a
            coupon aggregator, and Spendwrite, a yelp-like
            site that would host user reviews for local
            businesses.

            During my college days, I was hired by
            CivicSpace USA as a Summer Training Intern,
            where I worked on some ecommerce related
            Drupal modules.
